              Animals (also referred to as metazoa) are multicellular eukaryotic
              organisms that form the biological kingdom Animalia.

              <p class="animal">Animal Classification</p>

              In order for us to understand how all living organisms are related,
              they are arranged into different groups. The more features that a
              group of animals share, the more specific the group is.

              <p class="kingdom">Kingdom</p>
              All living organisms are first placed into different kingdoms. There
              are five different kingdoms to classify life on Earth, which are
              Animals, Plants, Fungi, Bacteria, and Protists (single-celled
              organisms).

              <p class="phylum">Phylum</p>
              The animal kingdom is divided into 40 smaller groups, known as phylum.
              Here, animals are grouped by their main features.

              <h3>Class</h3>
              The phylum group is then divided into even smaller groups, known as
              classes.

              <h3>Order</h3>
              Each class is divided into small groups again, known as orders. The
              class Mammalia (Mammals), splits into different groups including
              Carnivora, Primate, Artiodactyla and Rodentia.

              <h3>Family</h3>
              In every order, there are different families of animals which all have
              very similar features. The Carnivora order breaks into families that
              include Felidae (Cats), Canidae (Dogs), Ursidae (Bears), and
              Mustelidae (Weasels).

              <h3>Genus</h3>
              Every animal family is then divided into small groups known as genus.
              Each genus contains animals that have very similar features and are
              closely related.

              <h3>Species</h3>
              Each individual species within the genus is named after it's
              individual features and characteristics.
